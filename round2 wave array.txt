Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Modify the array to look like a wave. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....
Note: The converted array must be the lexicographically smallest wave array.

class Solution:
    def convertToWave(self, arr, N):
        for i in range(0,N-1,2):
            t=arr[i]
            arr[i]=arr[i+1]
            arr[i+1]=t
